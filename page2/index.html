    <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2017</span>

    <p><img src="images/vscode.png" alt="Visual Studio Code" /></p>

<p>I’m interrupting normal blogging service to give a shout out to Visual Studio Code, on Linux. I 
was put onto it by one of my students, and I’ve been running it for the last week as a daily driver when 
train-coding. And it’s great.</p>

<p>Normally I use Emacs or Vim, depending on the mood, and I have done for years, but both of them require a 
fair bit of setup, and I’ve always got a second terminal open for compilation / launching
the executable.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code, while not quite as nice as either of those from the text editing pov, is easily on a 
par with something like Sublime Text, but with a special party trick: it integrates extremely well with GCC &amp; GDB.</p>

<p>You can setup a problem parser, which will grep gcc’s output, allowing you to quickly jump to compilation errors, and
it’ll launch GDB and act as a front-end, allowing you to hover-inspect variables and do all the things you’d
expect from a larger IDE.</p>

<p>And it’s nippy. Surprisingly nippy. In fact, for C/C++ programming, this has quickly become my go-to editor 
on Linux. I can heartily recommend it.</p>

<p>If there’s one nitpick, it’s the lack of horizontal splits. Something Visual Studio seems to be partially 
allergic to, as well. But other than that, if you’re a Linux coder and you want some of the trappings of an 
IDE, without installing something shit like Eclipse, or slow and lethargic like QT Creator, VS Code is well
worth checking out.</p>

<p>And I can’t believe I’m saying that.</p>

<p>Bar teaching, the last two weeks have been entirely focused on Next Game, so I’ve managed to get quite a lot done.</p>

<p>Character movement is essentially ‘finished’. It’s pretty nippy - Quake 1 fast, in fact - but it feels nice and responsive. At least to me . Rocket Jumps will be featuring heavily, so spending the time to play around with this in order to get the height and distance nailed, was essential. Changes from here-on will just be tiny number tweaks, so I’m at the point now where I feel safe to begin whiteboxing levels.</p>

<p>The player’s inventory management is also working. You can cycle through weapons, pick up armour and health, as well as take damage. Armour modifiers still need to be added but I know exactly how these will operate.</p>

<p>UE’s weapon and projectile systems took a while to figure out, but I do now have 3 basic types that should cover everything I intend to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Projectile based: rocket launcher / nail gun, stuff like that.</li>
  <li>Instant shot: Pistols</li>
  <li>Instant multi-shot: Shotguns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weapons have individual fire rates, can spawn splash damage areas and their damage can attenuate over distance. The only thing you might expect that’s missing - especially if you play something like COD - is projectile penetration. I’m toying with the idea of adding this, but right now my guess is that it’ll be pretty useless within the sort of levels that I intend to create.</p>

<p>None of the weapons have been properly setup atm, as that’s something I’ll do once some NPCs are in. I need moving targets to shoot at!</p>

<p>I’ve also had a crash course in the localisation system, configuring animation blueprints, playing audio and have dipped my toe into Cascade again.</p>

<p>For the most part the last two weeks have been really productive, but I’ve been badly burned by a couple of things. One of the worst was discovering that UE4 types get garbage-collected quite aggressively. If, say, you have a TArray of elements but don’t add the UPROPERTY() macro above their definition, then at some point they’ll disappear from under you. It took me a few hours to work out exactly what was causing the crash and why, as it was appearing fairly randomly - and taking the editor out with it - but like everything, it’s completely obvious once you spot it.</p>

<p>I’ve also learned the hard way that Play In Editor - PIE - masks a certain type of class initialisation bug. Stupidly, I had a set of FText variables defined outside the class (they were static char arrays at first) which compiled perfectly fine, and even ran in the editor, but cooked builds would immediately crash. It took me a couple of hours to realise that it wasn’t my Anti Virus, or some auto-build failure, but UE4 barfing when trying to initialise the variable before the engine had started up. This was happening before the splash screen was appearing, so I wasn’t even getting a log to help… Again, totally obvious once you spot it.</p>

<p>I probably lost a day bug hunting this stuff, so I’m a little behind where I wanted to be this week -  ammo pickups are half done, and weapon pickups haven’t been started - but I’m basically at the point where I can play around with some look and feel tests, and maybe start white-boxing some spaces to run around in. I’m also growing in confidence with the engine and my ability to at least fix my own fuck-ups, so it’s probably a net win…</p>

<p>I’ve added a little video to You Tube for those who want a peek (see the top of this post). It should go without saying that none of the assets in this are final, or even likely to appear in-game. It’s bits and bobs from Lumo and UE4’s example assets, that I’ve thrown together. Although I did lose a good chunk of time over Xmas playing with the lighting and post, just to see how it worked ;D</p>

<p>The music is by Steve Birch, from the album Wonderland, that’ll be released by Joof sometime in Feb.</p>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Apologies. The blog was on a temporary hiatus through December, as I had to prepare for a programming course that I’m 
due to give at TAMK University this year. That meant getting up-to-speed with the latest Unity version,<br />
and writing a simple game that’ll form the basis of the course. As well as having a Xmas Holiday.</p>

<p>But I did do some work and make some decisions. The first of which: Oh Snow! is canned. Probably forever. Why?
Short answer; it was meant to be my toy project, not something that took a year to make, and due to teaching 
and signing up for a Finnish language course, I basically did nothing on it. But I did learn some Unreal, so it 
wasn’t a complete waste.</p>

<p>That means <em>Next Game</em> has officially been started. Here’s a little WIP screenie:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2017-01-06-PsyanceTestRoom.jpg"><img src="/images/2017-01-06-PsyanceTestRoom.jpg" alt="It's an FPS!" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, it’s an FPS. No, I’ve not done any graphics or modelling yet. And yes, that’s the default UE4 character model.</p>

<p>More info on <em>Next Game</em> in a later update.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Unity 5.5.x, and eating mince pies(+), I’ve done some more on Neutrino. The choice of using cmake for the 
build process turned out to be an excellent one. I thought I’d have a pop at getting the game running on windows, and although 
the cmake gui is a bit weird, once I worked out the intricacies it spat out a Visual Studio 2015 solution and Neutrino built and ran 
first time. And yeah, that surprised the hell out of me.</p>

<p>I’ve been continuing my love-in with ImGui, and decided that the effort to parse TileD tilemaps and integrate them into everything else 
I want to do was becoming a monumental pain in the arse. And I quite fancy rendering the tilemap through a pixel shader <a href="http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/07/sprite-tile-maps-on-gpu.html">a little like this</a>.
So I’ve started writing a simple tilemap editor in-engine. Exactly what I said I wouldn’t do. Ahem.</p>

<p>Early doors. I’m at the point where I can click a tile and move it about.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2017-01-06-StartOftheTilemap.png"><img src="/images/2017-01-06-StartOftheTilemap.png" alt="It's a tilemap editor. Ish" /></a></p>

<p>(+) I hate mince pies.</p>

        PS4 v1.02 Save Games

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2016</span>

    <p>A few people have still experienced the save icon corruption on PS4 and have posted to the Steam forums for info. Mart from RSG just posted the 
following steps which should fix the issue for anyone that’s upgraded from the previous build, but still has problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure the game isn’t running.</li>
  <li>Check that you’re running V1.02 - you can do that by highlighting the game icon on the PS4 home menu, pressing Options and choosing Update History. If you’re not, download the update from the same Options menu.</li>
  <li>From the PS4 home menu, go into Settings &gt; Application Saved Data Management &gt; Saved Data In System Storage &gt; Delete and then go to Lumo.</li>
  <li>You should see two files - Player Preferences and Lumo Save Slot 0. The latter is the one that’s causing all the trouble (the system should even tell you it’s corrupted), so delete it.</li>
  <li>Exit back to the PS4 home menu and start the game again. The game will create new save data and that should be the end of all the problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trouble appears to be that on PS4, deleting/reinstalling the game does NOT remove the save files - you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>I know this is a massive ball-ache if you’ve managed to get a fair distance through the game, and I can only apologise. As far as we know this does solve the 
issue and v1.02 should be stable for you.</p>

        Lumo Build Updates
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2016</span>

    <p>The Windows 10 Anniversary update caused a lot of weird issues with how gamepads work, leaving Lumo and a bunch of other games
with broken controls. I’ve just pushed out a new build to Steam that should fix most of these problems.</p>

<p>It’s been tested with the following pads:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PS4</li>
  <li>Xbox 360 (Wired and Wireless)</li>
  <li>XBox One (wired)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other joypads should work, but may require you to define your own controller mappings in Settings-&gt;Controls. Fight sticks are not directly supported, unfortunately, 
as many of them don’t identify themselves as pads, even though the may map to something like the default Xbox 360 layout (like my SF IV Fight Stick does).</p>

<p>In addition to this I’ve re-written the redefine controls screen [and back-end], fixing several small issues that have been in there since release.</p>

<p>Other fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Several affected achievements re-written</li>
  <li>Small balancing changes</li>
  <li>Clue added to the Ice Cube Stairs room</li>
</ul>

<p>Mac and Linux were unaffected by the original bugs but I’ve put out new versions for all platforms just in-case. DRM free builds are uploading now and should go live in the next day or two.</p>

<p>In addition - if this wasn’t bad enough -  Playstation 4 owners have been plagued by a save icon corruption for the last month. Withouth going into too much detail (<em>cough</em>Unity<em>cough</em>) I can 
confirm that the fix for this, on both PS4 and Vita, went live today. Phew :)</p>

<p>Apologies to all affected by these breakages, I know it’s been a complete nightmare. :(</p>
